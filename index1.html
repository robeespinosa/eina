          Do not worry, any problem has occurred, I'm just going to explain what this project consists of. <br> <br>
         In the previous page you can find all the work done in the subject Color and Volume of the Univ. Degree taught at EINA
          
          
         <br> <br>
           My first contact with the graphic design was in the old computer of my parents when my was 10 year old, began to draw in paint hours and hours, this web page is my little tribute to my past self.
            <br> <br>
         I hope that the work done is to your liking and enjoy the experience. On the home screen you can draw on any white background, click anywhere to go back.
